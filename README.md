# Geolocalizador-RT
This is a demo of a geolocalization system in Real-Time. The aim of this project is to test the implementation of sockets in C and to test the Linux-RT scheduling.

In this case, there is not a real implementation. The client just generates random coordinates and sends them to the server. A real implementation could be done using a GPS.
